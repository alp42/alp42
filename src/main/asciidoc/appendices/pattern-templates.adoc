== Pattern Templates

Patterns should be written in a more or less formal way.
A common structure makes it easier to compare patterns and find the best fitting one for a concrete problem.

At the moment alp42 uses two different pattern structures.
A simple and leightweight one based on the pattern approach by <<schuetz-pattern, Didi SchÃ¼tz et.al.>>.
The other template follows the more exhaustive pattern structure used by Mary Lynn Manns and Lynda Rising for their <<manns-fearless,Fearless Change Patterns>>.

You can find ready-to-use tempaltes for both structures in our https://github.com/alp42/alp42/tree/master/src/main/resources/templates[GitHub Repository]
